# Real-Estate_Price_Prediction
The Data Science Project determines the step by step process of how to build a real estate prediction website.
Predicting real estate prices involves complex factors and is influenced by various economic, social, and market conditions. In this project, as a data scientist, I had worked on developing a linear Regression model. The dataset was fetched from Keggle.com, representing the home price data for the bangalore city. Worked on different data scince concepts like Data Cleaning, Feature Engineering, One Hot Encoding, Dimensionality Reduction, etc. The model was further exported to a pickle file and generated a python flask server determing a user interface representing the price prediction of a real-estate property on the basis of different features like sq.ft., no. of bedrooms, locations, etc.

Factors affecting real estate prices include:

Location: This is one of the most significant factors. Properties in desirable neighborhoods with good schools, access to amenities, low crime rates, and proximity to employment centers tend to have higher prices.

Supply and Demand: The balance between the number of properties available (supply) and the number of buyers (demand) greatly influences prices. In areas with high demand and limited supply, prices are likely to rise.

Economic Conditions: The overall health of the economy, including factors like employment rates, GDP growth, and consumer confidence, affects the purchasing power of potential buyers and their willingness to invest in real estate.

Interest Rates: Mortgage interest rates impact buyers' affordability. Lower rates can stimulate demand, leading to higher prices, while higher rates can dampen demand and lower prices.

Market Trends: Real estate markets can experience cycles of boom and bust. Understanding where a market is in this cycle can provide insights into potential price movements.

Local Development: New infrastructure, commercial centers, and public facilities can enhance the desirability of an area and lead to higher property values.

Demographics: Changes in population demographics, such as an influx of younger professionals or retirees, can influence demand for different types of properties.

Government Policies and Regulations: Changes in zoning laws, property taxes, rent controls, and other regulations can impact property values.

Investor Activity: Real estate investors can have a significant impact on prices, especially in areas with high investor interest.

Property Condition: The state of a property, its age, maintenance, and improvements can affect its value.

Predicting real estate prices accurately requires detailed analysis, historical data, economic forecasts, and often involves using specialized tools and models. Real estate professionals, economists, and data analysts use methods like regression analysis, machine learning, and artificial intelligence to make informed predictions.

If you're interested in making specific real estate predictions, it's recommended to consult with real estate experts or professionals who have access to up-to-date data and specialized tools for analysis. Keep in mind that even experts can't guarantee precise predictions due to the complexity and uncertainty of real estate markets.
